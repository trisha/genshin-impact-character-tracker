# Genshin Impact Character Tracker
A browser-based app for manually tracking your Genshin Impact characters and their stats, and for managing your in-game goals.

The purpose of this project is to have all your character information stored online, which you can bookmark or keep open in a tab, and which takes less time to load than the actual game itself. You can add, edit, and delete your goals or notes for each character in the dashboard view--no need to flip through pages of crossed-out notes anymore!

## How to Setup After Cloning:
1. Install node dependencies: 
```npm install```
- Install the Sequelize CLI if you don't have it already: `npm i sequelize-cli` or `npm i -g sequelize-cli` to install globally

2. Create a SQL database called "genshin_tracker" (Make sure that the config.json database name matches your database name): `psql`, `CREATE DATABASE genshin_tracker;`
3. Migrate models: `sequelize db:migrate`
4. Run the API to populate the stockCharacter model: `node server_api.js`
5. Run the code: `node server.js` or `nodemon` (if you have nodemon installed)
6. Go to port 3000 in your browser: `localhost:3000`

## Features
- Sequelize hook to convert email address to lowercase before validating 
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Local login authentication using passport
- Multi-select and search from a dynamic dropdown list when adding characters
- Multi-select edit and delete character comments
- Dynamic CSS: see what happens when you adjust your browser size ðŸ‘€
- Colored text dependent on each character's vision (element)

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS, Scss
- JavaScript
- Express
- Node.js
- EJS, EJS Layouts 
- Bootstrap, Bootstrap-select
- Axios (for API calls)
- Passport (for user authentication)
- Bcrypt (for password hashing)

## Next Steps
- Add confirmation modal when deleting character.
- Have 'add new note' more visible (instead of at bottom), perhaps on side
- Have Edit and Delete note buttons more visible, perhaps as a float
- Update Characters view  to match Figma wireframes

## Background:
Whenever I talk about anything related to my characters in Genshin Impact on Reddit or with my friends--such as character builds or team compositions--I find that I oftentimes have to open the game just to see what my character's stats are, the name and level of their weapon they're using, or which artifacts (plus their main- and sub- stats) they have equipped. 

I also keep forgetting if I can use my resin (i.e. Genshion's stamina currency) on artifacts, or whether I should use them on today's ascension domains. 

And I'll forget which specific artifacts I'm farming for each character (in order to fulfill artifact set bonuses): Whenever I see my domain drops, I have to find my physical list of artifacts so I can know whether I'm done running a domain or whether I should continue to do another run.

This app arose from the intersection of the pain points above, and the exigence below.

<!-- 3/8/21 Feedback from Dave:
x Remove mention of bcrypt on homepage.
- Add 'stroke' for geo text, since hard to read.
x Have images open in new tab.
- Confirm password when signing up.
- Add profile page (instead of 404 not found).
- Have Delete button display a 'Confirm Delete' and 'Cancel' button show up. 
- Issue when adding all characters at once: font color doesn't show up, everything is white.
